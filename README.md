## Description.

Created this GG App using vue, vuex, pinia, vite, Fetch, es6+, leaflet and some npm packages.

Its a responsive shopping app.



### Home-page: 

- on the home page there is description and product categories and quantities that are got from store gettere.


### Shop-page: 

- There is a products list display. 
- you can search for products.
- you will go to product page if you click on a product.



### Product-page

- on the product page you can see the product details
- and add the product to cart

### Cart-page

- on the cart page you can see the added products and its details ( stock, shipping)
- add and remove the products.
- and the total of the products


the app is responsive for laptops and mobiles. 



Bonus Points
- API error handling - I have added the async, await and try catch, error throwing.
- State management - added state management pinia : state, actions, getters,
- ES6+ features (example: async/await) - used async await, variables, arrow functions etc.
- Modern CSS patterns : used min, max and media queries. 
- Server Side Rendering : due to short-time I left it with setup.  added server.js, entry-client and entry-server.
- Page performance/Lighthouse: tried browser lighthouse. 
- Accessibility and SEO: used all the semantic elements, added alt for images, used readable colors and background.
- Performance-optimized API usage : used API in an action with async await and error catching.
- Lazy-loading non critical UI components: added lazy loading in the router via import at component
- Unit tests : added unit tests
- CSS UI Patterns : i have used css pattern on the home page for category tiles
- Usage of webpack for bundling and code splitting : used vite.

and I tried to design the layout well and  match the colors.
added responsiveness.
